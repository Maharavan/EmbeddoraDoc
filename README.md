# EmbeddoraDoc


Data Ingestion Optimizations
Why:

If documents are too big or too noisy, retrieval quality drops → LLM sees irrelevant info → hallucinations increase.

Actions:

Smart Chunking:

Use RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with chunk_size=800–1200, overlap=100–200.

Prevents cutting sentences in half → better embeddings → better retrieval.

Metadata tagging:

Add source, page number, section titles to each chunk → helps with citations.

Async & incremental ingestion:

Use asyncio or concurrent.futures for bulk file processing.

Allow adding only new files instead of reprocessing all.

2. Retrieval Layer Improvements
Why:

Your current FAISS retriever may miss relevant info or return irrelevant chunks.

Actions:

Hybrid Retrieval (BM25 + FAISS):

Combine keyword search with semantic search → best recall.

Tools: BM25Retriever or ElasticSearch + FAISS.

Dynamic Top-K:

If query is simple → fewer docs; complex → more docs. Saves cost & latency.

Query Expansion:

Use LLM to rewrite queries for better recall (e.g., synonyms).

3. Re-ranking Layer
Why:

Even top-k chunks from FAISS aren’t always the best chunks for your question.

Actions:

Cross-encoder re-ranking:

Example: ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 or monoT5.

Scores each query-doc pair → reorders top-k → much higher precision.

Context Compression:

Summarize chunks before sending to LLM → prevents prompt overflow.

4. Generation Layer Optimizations
Why:

The way you prompt and pass context affects final answer quality & cost.

Actions:

Custom Prompt Templates:

Include system role, answer format, and "don’t hallucinate if info not found."

Map-Reduce or Refine Chains:

For long contexts, break into smaller parts, summarize, then combine.

Citations & Source Links:

Always return chunk IDs or URLs with the final answer.

5. System & Performance Optimizations
Why:

Latency, cost, and scalability become big issues in production.

Actions:

Caching:

Use langchain.cache or Redis for recent queries → instant responses for repeats.

Batch Embedding:

Avoid embedding one chunk at a time; embed in batches.

GPU Acceleration:

Run FAISS on GPU if available.

Monitoring & Evaluation:

Use RAGAS or TruLens to track:

Faithfulness (is answer grounded in docs?)

Relevance (is retrieved context relevant?)

Secrets & Config:

Move API keys to .env or Azure Key Vault / AWS Secrets Manager.

Deployment:

Containerize with Docker, deploy on AKS/EKS, auto-scale with KEDA.

6. Optional Advanced Features

Multi-turn Conversations: Store chat history with memory modules.

Agentic RAG: LLM can call tools (e.g., DB queries, APIs) if docs lack answers.

Long-context LLMs: Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o for 100K+ tokens if needed.

Guardrails: Add filters for hallucinations & prompt injection attacks
